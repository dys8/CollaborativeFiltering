# CollaborativeFiltering

In this project, we use a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) to construct a Collaborative Filtering based recommendation system. 
The system recommends items by searching for users that are similar to each other based on their item rating.

The data is acquired from http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/. 

- The dataset (ml-latest) describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from MovieLens, a movie recommendation service. 

- It contains 27753444 ratings and 1108997 tag applications across 58098 movies.
